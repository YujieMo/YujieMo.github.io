Hi, I'm Yujie Mo (Ëé´ÂÆáÊù∞ in Chinese). I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaofeng Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-bk1CrcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My research interests include graph representation learning and self-supervised/unsupervised learning. 
Previously, I got my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and Technology at Northeastern University (Shenyang, China) in 2020. Later, I was admitted to UESTC for a Master‚Äôs degree in 2020 and transferred to pursue the Ph.D. degree in 2022. And now, I am a visiting Ph.D. student of Learning and Vision (LV) Lab at the National University of Singapore under the supervision of Prof. [Xinchao Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w69Buq0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Check my CV for more details.

Welcome to contacting me about research or internship by emails.
